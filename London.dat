Falling down, falling down.

Build it up with wood and clay,
Wood and clay, wood and clay,
Build it up with wood and clay,
my fair lady.
MY fair lady...
Wood and clay will wash away,
Wash away, wash away,
Wood and clay will wash away,
my fair lady.
MY fair lady...
Build it up with bricks and mortar,
Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar,
Build it up with bricks and mortar,
my fair lady.
MY fair lady...
